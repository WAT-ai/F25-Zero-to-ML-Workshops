    "## Common Python Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Just before we wrap up, we wanted to showcase some python libraries that you might find useful for side projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Python Modules and Libraries?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python modules are files containing Python code that you can import and use in your programs. Think of them as toolboxes - instead of building every tool from scratch, you can use pre-built tools that experts have already created and tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem modules solve**: Without modules, every programmer would have to write code for common tasks like making web requests, working with dates, or processing data. Modules let you leverage the work of other experts instead of having to reinvent the wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Libraries vs. Modules**: A module is a single Python file, while a library is a collection of related modules. In practice, people often use these terms interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding and Installing Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyPI (Python Package Index)**: [https://pypi.org](https://pypi.org) is the official repository for Python packages. It contains over 400,000 packages covering everything from web development to machine learning. Any developer (maybe even you one day) can contribute to Pypi by publishing their own packages for others to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing packages**: Use `pip install package-name` to install any package from PyPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finding documentation**: \n",
    "- Check the package's PyPI page for links to documentation\n",
    "- Most packages host their documentation on [readthedocs.io](https://readthedocs.io): `https://package-name.readthedocs.io`\n",
    "- Use `help(module_name)` in Python to see built-in documentation\n",
    "- Check the package's GitHub repository for examples and README files\n",
    "\n",
    "With that out of the way, let's look at some packages\n",

    "### How to Learn New Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with the official documentation** - most libraries have excellent getting-started guides\n",
    "2. **Look for \"quickstart\" or \"tutorial\" sections** - these show common use cases\n",
    "3. **Check examples on GitHub** - search for repositories using the library\n",
    "4. **Use help() in Python**: `help(pandas.DataFrame)` shows built-in documentation\n",
    "5. **Read the docstrings**: Use `library.function.__doc__` to see function documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Always use virtual environments for projects\n",
    "python -m venv myproject-env\n",
    "source myproject-env/bin/activate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install specific versions if needed\n",
    "pip install pandas==1.5.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save your project dependencies\n",
    "pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install from requirements file (useful when sharing projects)\n",

    "- **Image processing**: Pillow, OpenCV\n",
    "- **GUI applications**: tkinter, PyQt, Kivy\n",
