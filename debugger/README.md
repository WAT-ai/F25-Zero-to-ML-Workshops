## Debugging Practice

You'll need step-through debugging ALL the time in jobs and throughout university. This exercise is to get you comfortable with it. 

Check out [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qZBwhSlfOo) and then practice debugging the `buggy_script.py` file in this directory. By the end, you should be comfortable with: 
- Setting breakpoints to stop the code before an error occurs
- Stepping through the code line-by-line, into and out of functions
- Inspecting variables to check if they have the values you expect
- Understanding the call stack to see how you got to a certain point in the code
