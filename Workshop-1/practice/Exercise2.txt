Exercise 2: Data Exploration - Results
========================================

Part 1: Find appearances of the word 'sunny'
---------------------------------------------
Command:
  curl http://wttr.in/Toronto | grep -i "sunny"

Explanation:
  - curl fetches the weather report from the API
  - grep -i searches for "sunny" (case-insensitive)
  - Found 6 lines containing "Sunny"


Part 2: Count how many times 'sunny' appears
---------------------------------------------
Command:
  curl http://wttr.in/Toronto | grep -io "sunny" | wc -l

Explanation:
  - curl fetches the weather report
  - grep -io extracts only the word "sunny" (-o for only matching, -i for case-insensitive)
  - wc -l counts the number of lines (each line has one "sunny")
  
Result: 7 occurrences of the word "sunny"


Part 3: Show how often every word is used (CHALLENGE)
------------------------------------------------------
Command:
  curl http://wttr.in/Toronto | tr -cs '[:alpha:]' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

Explanation:
  1. curl http://wttr.in/Toronto - Fetch the weather report
  2. tr -cs '[:alpha:]' '\n' - Translate non-alphabetic chars to newlines (one word per line)
  3. sort - Sort words alphabetically
  4. uniq -c - Count unique words and show the count
  5. sort -rn - Sort by count in reverse numerical order (highest first)

Results (Top words by frequency):
  296 m        (from km/h and mm)
   26 km
   13 mm
   13 h
   13 C

Key Concepts Learned:
---------------------
- Pipe operator (|): Connects command outputs to inputs
- grep: Search for patterns in text
  - -i flag: case-insensitive search
  - -o flag: only output matching parts
- wc: Word count command
  - -l flag: count lines
  - -w flag: count words
- tr: Translate or delete characters
- sort: Sort lines of text
- uniq -c: Count unique occurrences
- Command chaining: Building complex operations from simple commands
